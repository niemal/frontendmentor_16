## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Animations
- [react](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I did my best to polish my skills and closed it up with a confetti animation (!). By implementing smooth animations my overall knowledge has expanded, and this was clearly a bothersome advanced task to handle. Looking forward to the next advanced one.
